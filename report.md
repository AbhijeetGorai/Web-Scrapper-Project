## 1. Legal Provisions and Misinterpretations: The Case of Dowry Laws in India

### Background
The article titled "‘False’ dowry cases are not evidence of feminism gone rogue — they only show that India’s justice system is failing" underscores a critical issue in the Indian justice system concerning the application and perception of dowry laws. Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, intended to protect women from domestic abuse and dowry-related harassment, often faces allegations of misuse.

### Analysis

Women often resort to legal measures as a last resort, emphasizing a failure in the justice system to provide timely and effective remedies.
